## PAGANZ 2017 Shiny Population Analysis Workshop
*6th February â€“ 8th February 2017*

The 18th annual Population Approach Group in Australia and New Zealand (PAGANZ) meeting was held in Adelaide, Australia from Monday 6th to Wednesday 8th February. A population analysis workshop (PAWS) was included in the PAGANZ meeting.

The workshop will consisted of lectures and hands-on exercises at a computer. During the hands-on exercises, tutors were available for consultation and assistance. The Intermediate workshop covered "Shiny apps in R for simulation". This repository contains the slides and code from this workshop.

### Repository Content

The workshop consisted of a theoretical component (`man_slides_theory.pptx`) and a hands-on component (`man_slides_handson.pptx`). The code for the workshop consists of the basic example app shown in the theory component `theory_basic_example`, the skeleton and final application that was built by attendees during the hands-on component (`skel_deSolve_app` and `test_deSolve_app`).

In addition to the workshop content, this repository also includes previous shiny training material by Jessica Wojciechowski (including Shiny webinar, ACOP tutorial and CPTPSP tutorial), an example of capturing the "state" of an application when using renderUI (application originally from https://github.com/jhhughes256/shinyapps) and a validation of the ODE solver code in deSolve and mrgsolve used in the hands-on application
